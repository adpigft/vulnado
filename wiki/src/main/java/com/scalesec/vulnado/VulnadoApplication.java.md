# Documentation: `VulnadoApplication.java`

## Overview
The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ServletComponentScan`, enabling Spring Boot's auto-configuration and scanning for servlet components. The application also includes a call to a custom `Postgres.setup()` method, which likely initializes database-related configurations.

## Class: `VulnadoApplication`

### Purpose
This class is the main entry point for the application. It initializes the Spring Boot framework and performs any necessary setup for the application, such as database configuration.

### Annotations
| Annotation              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication`| Combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration and component scanning. |
| `@ServletComponentScan` | Enables scanning for servlet components, such as filters and servlets, within the application. |

### Methods

#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Purpose**: The main method serves as the entry point for the Java application. It initializes the Spring Boot application and performs database setup.
- **Logic**:
  1. Calls `Postgres.setup()` to perform database-related initialization.
  2. Invokes `SpringApplication.run()` to start the Spring Boot application.

---

## Insights

1. **Database Setup**: The `Postgres.setup()` method is invoked before starting the Spring Boot application. This indicates that the application relies on a PostgreSQL database, and the setup method likely handles connection initialization or schema preparation.

2. **Servlet Component Scanning**: The use of `@ServletComponentScan` suggests that the application may include custom servlets, filters, or listeners that need to be registered and managed by the Spring framework.

3. **Spring Boot Framework**: The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation simplifies the configuration process by enabling auto-configuration and component scanning, making it easier to build and deploy the application.

4. **Modular Design**: The separation of database setup into a dedicated `Postgres.setup()` method promotes modularity and maintainability, allowing database-related logic to be encapsulated and reused.

---

## Dependencies
- **Spring Boot**: Provides the core framework for building and running the application.
- **Postgres**: A custom class or utility for handling PostgreSQL database setup.
